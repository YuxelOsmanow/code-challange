The Challange :

Create a simple event listing

A new custom post type for Events
The custom post type needs to have a few custom fields:
- event date (date picker)
- event location
- URL for the event

We need an archive page which will list all events, ordered by event date. Each event should have a title, location (you can add a Google map integration), event date, a link to the external source/site.
We need to have a simple "Add to Google Calendar" button, which will add the event to your google calendar.

The Solution :

This repository contains the theme that solves this issue but only the issue ( no further like page's style, post etc. ). The database is within the repository. The theme itself has ReadMe. The theme requires "composer", you can get it from here - https://getcomposer.org/download/
